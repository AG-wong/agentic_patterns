       "Overall, your implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm is correct and well-documented. Here are some minor suggestions for improvement:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Docstrings:** Your docstrings are excellent, but you might consider adding a `:rtype:` specification to indicate the return type of each function. For example, `:rtype: list` would indicate that the function returns a list.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Type Hints:** Adding type hints for function parameters and return types can improve code readability and help with static type checking. For example, `def merge_sort(arr: list) -> list:` would indicate that the function takes a list as input and returns a list.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Error Handling:** Your implementation assumes that the input array only contains comparable elements (e.g., integers or strings). However, if the input array contains uncomparable elements (e.g., a mix of integers and strings), your implementation will raise a `TypeError`. You might consider adding error handling to handle such cases.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Code Organization:** Your code is well-organized, but you might consider moving the `merge` function inside the `merge_sort` function as a nested function. This would emphasize that the `merge` function is a helper function for the `merge_sort` function and is not intended to be used independently.\n",

      "\n",
      "The provided code is well-structured, easy to understand, and correctly implements the Merge Sort algorithm. However, there are a few areas that can be improved for better performance, readability, and robustness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Review**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Type Hints**: The code does not use type hints for function arguments and return types. Adding type hints can improve code readability and facilitate static type checking.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Docstrings**: While the code includes docstrings for functions, they can be improved by providing more details about the function's behavior and edge cases. For example, the `merge_sort` function should mention that the input list is modified in-place.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Error Handling**: The code does not handle errors that may occur when sorting non-comparable elements or when receiving non-list inputs. Adding error handling can make the code more robust.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Consistent Naming**: The variable `mid` uses lowercase and underscore, but `left_half` and `right_half` are camelCase. Python's PEP 8 recommends using lowercase with underscores for variable names.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Magic Numbers**: The code uses the magic number 1 in the `merge_sort` function. While this number is not likely to change, it's better to use a named constant to improve code readability.\n",

      "1.  **Use Type Hints**\n",

      "    ```python\n",
      "def merge_sort(arr: list) -> list:\n",
      "    ...\n",

      "        raise TypeError(\"Input list contains non-comparable elements\") from e\n",

      "4.  **Use Consistent Naming**\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "# Divide the list into two halves.\n",
      "left_half_list = arr[:mid]\n",
      "right_half_list = arr[mid:]\n",
      "```\n",
