       "**Code organization and style**\n",
       "\n",
       "* Your code is well-structured, and the function definitions are clear and concise. However, it would be better to separate the `merge_sort` and `merge` functions into their own sections, perhaps with a blank line between them. This would improve the readability of the code.\n",
       "* You're using consistent spacing and indentation, which is great. However, it's a good practice to follow the PEP 8 style guide, which recommends using four spaces for indentation.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Function documentation**\n",
       "\n",
       "* Your function docstrings are excellent! They clearly explain the purpose of each function, the input parameters, and the return values. However, it would be even better if you included some examples of usage for each function.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Performance and optimization**\n",
       "\n",
       "* Your implementation has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is optimal for the Merge Sort algorithm. However, you could consider using a more efficient merge function that uses a single loop instead of two separate loops for merging and extending the result array.\n",
       "* You're creating new lists for the left and right halves in the `merge_sort` function. While this is not a performance issue in Python, it's worth noting that this approach can lead to higher memory usage. In languages like C or C++, it's often better to sort the array in-place to avoid extra memory allocations.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Error handling and edge cases**\n",
       "\n",
       "* Your implementation assumes that the input array contains only comparable elements (e.g., numbers or strings). However, it's a good practice to add some error handling to handle unexpected input types or values. For example, you could check if the input array contains only hashable elements and raise a `TypeError` otherwise.\n",
       "* You're not handling the case where the input array is `None`. While this is not a critical issue, it's still a good idea to add a simple check at the beginning of the `merge_sort` function to return `None` if the input array is `None`.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Code reuse and testing**\n",
       "\n",
       "* It's great that you included an example usage of the `merge_sort` function. However, it would be even better to write some unit tests to ensure that the function works correctly for different input cases. You could use the `unittest` module in Python to write test cases.\n",
       "* Consider adding a `merge_sort` function that takes an optional `key` function as an argument, allowing the user to sort the array based on a custom key function. This would make the function more versatile and reusable.\n",
