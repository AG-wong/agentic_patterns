       "Overall, your implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm is correct and well-documented. Here are some minor suggestions for improvement:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Code Style and Readability**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Consistent Spacing: You've used both single and double spaces between lines. It's better to stick to a consistent convention throughout the code. PEP 8 recommends using a single blank line to separate logical sections of code.\n",
       "2.  Docstring formatting: The docstrings are well-written, but the formatting could be improved. You can use proper formatting for the docstrings by including a blank line between the description and the parameter list.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Performance and Optimization**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  No significant performance improvements are possible for the Merge Sort algorithm itself, as it has a lower bound of O(n log n) for comparison-based sorting. However, you could consider using a hybrid sorting algorithm like Timsort, which is a hybrid of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. Timsort is used as the default sorting algorithm in Python and Java.\n",
       "2.  In the `merge` function, you could use list comprehension to simplify the last two lines where you extend the `merged` list with the remaining elements from `left` and `right`. This would make the code more concise.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Best Practices and Testing**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Error Handling: You didn't include any error handling for invalid input. Consider adding a simple check at the beginning of the `merge_sort` function to ensure that the input is a list. You can raise a `TypeError` if the input is not a list.\n",
       "2.  Testing: While you provided an example of how to test the `merge_sort` function, it's better to write unit tests using Python's built-in `unittest` module. This would allow you to automate testing and ensure the function works correctly for various input scenarios.\n",

      "3.  **Use a Consistent Coding Style**: Your code mostly follows the PEP 8 coding style, but there are a few inconsistencies. Consider using a tool like `black` or `pycodestyle` to enforce a consistent coding style throughout your codebase.\n",
      "\n",
