       "Overall, your implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm is correct and well-documented. Here are some minor suggestions for improvement:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Code Style and Readability**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Consistent Spacing: You've used both single and double spaces between lines. It's better to stick to a consistent convention throughout the code. PEP 8 recommends using a single blank line to separate logical sections of code.\n",
       "2.  Docstring formatting: The docstrings are well-written, but the formatting could be improved. You can use proper formatting for the docstrings by including a blank line between the description and the parameter list.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Performance and Optimization**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  No significant performance improvements are possible for the Merge Sort algorithm itself, as it has a lower bound of O(n log n) for comparison-based sorting. However, you could consider using a hybrid sorting algorithm like Timsort, which is a hybrid of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. Timsort is used as the default sorting algorithm in Python and Java.\n",
       "2.  In the `merge` function, you could use list comprehension to simplify the last two lines where you extend the `merged` list with the remaining elements from `left` and `right`. This would make the code more concise.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Best Practices and Testing**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Error Handling: You didn't include any error handling for invalid input. Consider adding a simple check at the beginning of the `merge_sort` function to ensure that the input is a list. You can raise a `TypeError` if the input is not a list.\n",
       "2.  Testing: While you provided an example of how to test the `merge_sort` function, it's better to write unit tests using Python's built-in `unittest` module. This would allow you to automate testing and ensure the function works correctly for various input scenarios.\n",

      "1. **Correctness**: Your implementation is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given test case.\n",
      "2. **Readability**: Your code is well-structured, and the variable names are descriptive, making it easy to understand.\n",
      "3. **Recursion**: You've implemented the recursive approach correctly, which is a fundamental aspect of the Merge Sort algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Weaknesses and Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consistent Indentation**: In the `merge` function, you use both 4-space and 8-space indentation. It's essential to maintain consistency throughout the code. I recommend sticking to 4-space indentation, which is the standard in Python.\n",
      "2. **Type Hints**: Adding type hints for the function parameters and return types can improve code readability and make it easier for others to understand the function signature. For example, you can add type hints for the `merge_sort` function: `def merge_sort(arr: list[int]) -> list[int]:`.\n",
      "3. **Docstrings**: It's a good practice to include docstrings for functions, especially for more complex algorithms like Merge Sort. A docstring can provide a brief explanation of the function's purpose, parameters, and return values.\n",
      "4. **Error Handling**: Your implementation assumes that the input array only contains integers. Consider adding error handling to handle cases where the input array might contain non-integer elements or be None.\n",
      "5. **Performance**: While Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), your implementation can be optimized slightly. In the `merge` function, you can use `left_index < len(left)` instead of `left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right)` in the while loop condition, as the second condition is not necessary.\n",
      "6. **Function Naming**: The `merge` function is well-named, but you might consider renaming it to `merge_sorted_lists` to make its purpose more explicit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an updated version of your code incorporating these suggestions:\n",
      "```python\n",
