       "**Functionality**: The implementation correctly sorts the input array using the Merge Sort algorithm. The recursive division of the array into two halves and the merging of the sorted halves are implemented correctly.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Performance**: The time complexity of the Merge Sort algorithm is O(n log n), which is optimal for a comparison-based sorting algorithm. The space complexity is O(n), which is acceptable since we need to create a new sorted array.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Minor suggestions**:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. In the `merge` function, consider using a more descriptive variable name instead of `merged`. For example, you could use `result` or `sorted_merged`.\n",
       "2. In the `merge` function, the `left_index` and `right_index` variables are initialized to 0, but you could consider using more descriptive names like `left_ptr` and `right_ptr` to indicate that they are pointers into the `left` and `right` arrays.\n",
       "3. In the `merge_sort` function, you could consider adding a docstring that mentions the time and space complexity of the algorithm.\n",
       "4. The example usage code is a good idea, but you might want to consider adding more test cases to ensure the implementation is correct. For example, you could test the implementation with an empty array, an array with duplicate elements, or an array with negative numbers.\n",
       "\n",
       "**One potential improvement**: Currently, the `merge` function creates a new list `merged` to store the merged result. However, this list is created by concatenating the `left` and `right` arrays using the `extend` method, which can be slow for large arrays. Instead, you could consider using a single list `result` and appending elements to it one by one using the `append` method. This can reduce the memory allocation overhead and make the implementation more efficient.\n",
