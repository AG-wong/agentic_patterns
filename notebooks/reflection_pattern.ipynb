       "**Best Practices:**\n",

       "* You could consider handling edge cases, such as an empty input array or an array with a single element. Although your implementation already returns the original array for these cases, it's good practice to explicitly handle them.\n",
       "* You might want to consider adding error handling for cases where the input is not a list or is a list of non-comparable elements.\n",

       "**Code Style:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* The code follows PEP 8 guidelines, which is great.\n",

      "\n",
      "** Critiques: **\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Redundant comments**: Some of the comments, such as `\"This function sorts an array using the Merge Sort algorithm.\"`, are redundant and can be removed. The function name and docstring already convey this information.\n",
      "2. **Inconsistent spacing**: There are inconsistent spacing between lines and blocks of code. It's better to follow PEP 8 guidelines for consistent spacing.\n",
      "3. **Global variables**: The `arr` variable is used as a global variable in the example usage. It's better to pass it as an argument to the `merge_sort` function to make the code more modular and reusable.\n",
      "\n",
      "** Recommendations: **\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Type hints**: Consider adding type hints for the function parameters and return types to make the code more readable and self-documenting.\n",
      "2. ** Docstring improvements**: You can improve the docstrings by adding more details about the time and space complexity of the algorithm, as well as any assumptions or limitations.\n",
      "3. **Error handling**: Consider adding error handling to handle cases where the input array is not a list, or contains non-comparable elements.\n",
      "4. **Code organization**: You can consider breaking down the `merge_sort` function into smaller functions, each responsible for a specific task, such as dividing the array, merging the sub-arrays, and recursively sorting the sub-arrays.\n",
      "5. **Testing**: It's a good practice to add unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation. You can use Python's built-in `unittest` module to write tests for the `merge_sort` function.\n",
