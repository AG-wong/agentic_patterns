       "A clean and concise Merge Sort implementation!\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's my feedback:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Code organization and comments**: Your code is well-organized, and the comments are helpful. I especially like the docstrings that provide a brief summary of each function, including the time and space complexity. However, consider adding a blank line between the function signature and the docstring for better readability.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Naming conventions**: Your variable names are clear and concise. You might consider following PEP 8's convention of using underscores to separate words in variable names (e.g., `left_half` instead of `left`).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recursion**: Your recursive approach is correct, and you've handled the base case correctly (when the length of the array is 1 or less). However, consider adding a recursive case comment to explain the logic behind the recursive calls.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Merge function**: The `merge` function is well-implemented, but you might consider using a more descriptive variable name instead of `result`. For example, `merged_array` or `sorted_result`.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Performance**: Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is optimal for a comparison-based sorting algorithm. However, you might consider adding a note or comment about the fact that Merge Sort is a stable sort, meaning that the order of equal elements is preserved.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example usage**: Your example usage is clear, but you might consider adding a few more test cases to demonstrate the robustness of your implementation. For example, an empty array, an array with duplicate elements, or an array with negative numbers.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Minor nitpicks**:\n",
       "\n",
       "* In the `merge_sort` function, you can use a more concise way to check the length of the array: `if not arr:` instead of `if len(arr) <= 1:`.\n",
       "* In the `merge` function, you can use list slicing to create a copy of the remaining elements instead of extending the result list: `result.extend(left[:])` and `result.extend(right[:])`.\n",
